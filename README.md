# newCAR
Immunotherapy relies heavily upon the identification of a tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) which are highly expressed and tumor-specific.  To identify suitable TAAs, newCAR.R compares RNA and protein expression between tumor and control samples. Users must provide data matrices for tumor and control to determine TAAs in their disease of interest. Tumor and control datasets can be from different data cohorts, or even different platforms (e.g. RNA-seq vs microarray), since gene expression value transformations are performed to make the distribution of expression values equivalent.

newCAR allows for reproducibility of the workflow that we used to predict tumor-associated antigens in pediatric AMKL.  A function to perform the Weighted Cumulative Percentage (WCP) data transformation is also available in this repository to unify heterogenous data.

## Installation
Install `newCAR.R` by unpacking the source code to a working directory.

An configuration file [example](example_config.txt) is provided.

### Output
The name of the `newCAR.R` run (line 9 of the configuration file) is used to create an output directory.  The output directory contains *data matrices* and *boxplots* regarding the following TAAs:
